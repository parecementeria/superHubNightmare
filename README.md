:neckbeard: Automate Virgin Media super Hub restart using [Nightmarejs] (http://www.nightmarejs.org/)

## Motivation
After a day and a half restarting manually the super Hub every 20 min, We decided to create an automated way of doing this task so can be easily added to crontab. :tada::tada::tada:

## How to use it

First you will need to modify the index file with your SuperHub password.

Then simply:

```
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```
